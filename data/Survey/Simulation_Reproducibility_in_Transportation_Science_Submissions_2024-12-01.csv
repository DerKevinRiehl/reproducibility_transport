Our major grants are typically 300K spread over three years, spread across multiple institutions. I am lucky to get a single PhD student. Compare this to other areas that seem to have an infinite amount of research funds and staff. Collecting data and writing code is my competitive advantage. Why make it freely available so that others with far greater resources can then take the ideas and basically do what I have mapped out as my research objectives for the next 5 years. They can do it all in one year, using my data, and basing it on my codes. What is my incentive to basically give my research agenda away for free? ",1,4,4,5,1,1,"No","Two points. 1) Academia is not a level playing field. Collecting data and writing code is a skill that takes time. When I collect data, I do so with the aim of writing 5 or 6 papers from it. Say I publish both data and code. Then my competitors in Europe and the US who have 101 post docs and PhDs take the ideas and publish it before I can write paper 2. Workloads are such that much energy is spent teaching and doing other non-research activities, meaning that research time is extremely constrained and without the same resources others have, what is my incentive to do so. Reproducibility is one thing, and if others wish to take my ideas, collect their own data (I try and explain extensively how I collected it), they are free to do so, but I am not paid to do it for them.

2. Academia is fundamentally flawed as is (on so many levels). The issue isn't reproducing results on my data. The results should be replicated across multiple data. Sampling theory is such that we take one finite sample from a population, estimate models and publish. What if we drew another finite sample? Do we get the same results? The there is the issue of null results - the file draw problem. If the hypothesis is not proven, the paper typically doesn't get published. I would support a journal of replicable studies, but replication should extend beyond replicating a single study on a single finite sample.","10+","Tenure Track / Senior Professor","Australia & Oceania","There needs to be consideration about the negative externalities associated with this, not just the fact that people are checking the code is correct and trying to get a ""got you"" moment.

They will have access to infinite data with large support, and will write 10 times more papers, whilst the rest of us just become their data suppliers. Sorry, not interested in making others who are already successful moreso. They can do it on their own. If early career researchers contact me I go out of my way to help - share data and code, but on the condition it doesn't go to anyone else. These are the people who should be being helped."

"GO9zoz","5povBN","2024-11-12 12:59:05",5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,2,1,1,1,3,"My personal experience is that there is simply very little knowledge within the transport modelling community about how to ensure reproducability - not just in scientific communities, but also in the ""practice"", where engineers and planners run models to support real-life decision making. The lack of education about how to ensure reproducibilty of transport models is the first and largest hurdle that needs to be addressed.  In courses teaching transport modelling, the topic of reproducibility is not addressed. Thus, the entire workforce dealing with transport models lacks the basic concept of how reproducibily applies to their models, let alone the knowledge and tools to actually ensure reproducibility. Prof. Greg Erhart at the University of Kentucky could attest to this, since he and his team performed a MASSIVE reproducabiltiy study for the US government on the forecast accurcy of transport models in practice. 

And very closely tied to reproducibility (and especially forecast accuracy) is undesrtanding the uncertainty of model results. This topic is also shockingly, and I would say, depressingly, abscent from transport modelling. I found ONE report - done for the Swiss government - on uncertainties in the simplest of transport model types (the four step model). And only recently did researchers from Uni Stuttgart further that line of thought. I found ONE paper (from the Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore) that tried to begin to approach how to quantify the uncertainties in an activity-based model (very similar to an agent-based model, but not quite the same thing). And even more discoragingly, even though the end users of transport model results (governments in and instutions and companies in charge of transportation systems) have asked me for the ""confidence intervals"" of my model results (which points to the woeful lack of knowledge of the level of statistics necessary to actually quantitfy uncertainties of models as complex as most transport models, especially with their extremly messy, observational data), my attempt at getting funding to answer that question was denied.  

Furthermore, these problems (lack of reproducibilty, ignorance of the errors and uncertanties inherent in the models and their results) are exacerbated by conflicting and confusing language used to describe models, transport systems, human behavior, and the code used in the models themselves (so understanding how the software actually works). This is especially accute in agent-based modelling, where the researchers and other users either a) understand how to code or b) understand transporation or c) behavior modelling or d) data science, and rarely all four. 

Aside: it is ridiculous that we expect researches to be experts at all four - we need to accept that these models have become complex enough that you need MULTIPLE people with complimentary expertise to properly use them working as a team. The minimum team is one transportation expert (since these are usually well versed in both transport and behavioral modelling theory), one computer scientist, and one data scientist. 

For example of why such explicit requests for expertise in all four subjects AND the need for unified vocabulary specific to transport modelling that addresses all four subjects is needed: when I had to look at research on how to model passenger information systems, I tried to reproduce several researchers work, and found out that they did not understand the transport system, nor how the model represents the transport system and human behavior, nor did they have the appropriate language to describe either in a way that is useful for the three stakeholder groups (the modeller-computer scientist, the transport behavior researcher, the transport system operator). These researchesr were obviously computer scientists focused on the code and on optimization - and were woefully ignorant of how to model the system they were trying to optimize. This is not their fault- they were trained in optimization, not transport operations, nor transport modelling, nor behavioral science and modelling. But they wrote their papers as if they were. And they were not. And so their results are misleading and not what they claim they are. And their code was a mess and extremely difficult to reproduce (and I only had access because I knew people in their research group). That mess was probably because they were not given the time to properly clean up their code and document it, because the research funders wanted results now, with no respect for the work of modelling (see again: the entire transport modeling community lacks education on reproducability and uncertainty quantification!). ",5,5,5,5,5,5,"Yes","EDUCATION. 

Include reproducability in all courses, seminars, workshops, etc. on using transport models! 

How are people supposed to DO all of the above if they do not know how?  Because most do not know how. 

Also, all of the above solutions sound easy to someone who is tranined in software engineering or data science. But most transport planners and engineers ARE NOT. Just like most people with great software and data science skills are not trained in transport operations or planning! 

REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS OF THE RESEARCHERS THEMSELVES

Please, for the love of good science and good planning, make sure your team has A TEAM of researchers for modelling projects. Do not expect one person to be everything. The ETH is an exceptional place that attracts incredibly talented people, which skews expectations of what is reasonable to expect from one person. But here, I really think its cruel to require researchers and practioners to be PROFESSIONALS at both the coding and data science side of things and the transportation planning/behavioral science side of things. To do both properly is hereculean. Team work makes the dream work. Tell that to funders. Tell it to professors (who, frankly, are often JUST old enough that they do not understand that code and data have become exponentially more complex in the last 6 to 10 years and it is no longer easy to ""just learn how to code and deal with data"" and ALSO do it properly while ALSO being an transportation expert (in whichever flavor is needed - planning? Operations? Engineering? Design?).  ","5-10","PhD / Doctoral Student","Europe","thank you so much for addressing this incredibly important subject. 

Milos Balac at the ETH and Sebastian Hoerl (at some research institute in Paris), as well as Gregory Erhart at the University of Kentucky and Markus Friedrich at the Uni Stuttgart, and Kai Nagel at the TU Berlin would all be very good people to help you on this topic. They have all either researched it themselves (Erhart, Friedrich) or taken the initiative to ensure reproduciblity of their own models (Balac, Hoerl), or struggled to find the resources to ensure reproducibility while under intense pressure for results (Nagel).

I believe that policies towards study reproducibility need to consider that the data being used by researchers could be proprietary. Perhaps de-identified or synthetic data can be used with sample output to ensure that the described methodology is doing what it is designed to do is a good middle ground so that the researcher and readers can be assured that it was applied correctly. 
I'm of the belief that reproducibility should only help the review process, and the lack of it should call for more scrutiny from paper reviewers. In the case of not having the ability to share data, it should be noted in the final manuscript.","5-10","Post-Doc","North America",

My best work is when the models are used for behind-the-scenes evaluation and fine-tuning of policy.  The simulations ensure that when decision makers are making decisions, or the public are considering options, they are choosing from amongst the best, fine-tuned, options.  They are complex operational models with many GB of input data.  We publish selected results when we do something methodologically innovative, or summary results of entire projects.  

Most academic literature is ""minimum publishable units"" with a one or two grad students doing comparatively simple work, perhaps with one or two data sources that might not be confidential/private.  So, I agree that publishing data for reproducibility is a good goal for much research. But, it's just not possible for most of my simulation work. 

No disrespect, but one professor and a few grad students cannot build an entire complex simulation on all available data, and then convince a public agency to use it behind-the-scenes, in a no-risk private way, to explore policy options.

It would have been great if you had provided participants with the option to receive a copy of your analysis based on the survey responses.

Meanwhile, I feel that many researchers in our community have misconceptions about reproducible research. Many think reproducible research is only about open data + code sharing. In my opinion, a reproducibility campaign to raise awareness, combined with tutorials/workshops to guide researchers on how to begin practicing reproducible research, could be highly beneficial. BTW, you might be interested in some of the activities organized by the RERITE Working Group: https://www.rerite.org/

Wish you all the best with this great initiative. "
